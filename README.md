# Data Obtained from Consecutive treatments of methamphetamine promote the development of cardiac pathological symptoms in zebrafish
---

Dataset contains the tabulated data acquired from ECG recordings as well as molecular assays determining how the GPCR pathway is impacted. Zebrafish were treated with 200 uM of methamphetamine over the course of 2 weeks in order to assess the effect on heart physiology.


## Description of the Data and File Structure

The csv files titled 'Compiled ECG Data' describes the HR (heart rate), HRV (heart rate variation, calculated by RMSSD), QRS, PR, and QTc intervals, all parameters relevant for analyzing ECG. Two experimental groups were listed: control (no methamphetamine) and treated (200 uM methamphetamine), and ECG were recorded prior to any treatment (baseline), as well as subsequent days during the study, with Day 1 as the first day of the study. Both the mean and standard error are provided for the two trials conducted for this study, labeled correspondingly in the separate files. 

The supplemental figures are derived from the corresponding manuscript. Briefly, these figures include representative ECG figures, plotted ECG parameters as described above, as well as genetic expression and histological data corresponding to the consequences of methamphetamine treatment.
